\section*{Power Efficiency \& Capacitors}
\textbf{Question 1:} Consider a car that has 400 kJ of energy at a specific speed. The car's regenerative brakes are 40\% efficient at converting kinetic energy to energy stored in a battery. What is the energy added when the car brakes to half speed?

\textbf{Solution:}
% Solution steps
\begin{align*}
    KE_{o} &= \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \\
    KE_{\text{half}} &= \frac{1}{2} m {\left( \frac{v}{2} \right)}^{2}  = \frac{1}{2} m \cdot \frac{v^{2}}{4}  = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} m v^{2} =  \frac{1}{4} \times KE_{o} \\
    \Delta KE &= KE_{o} - KE_{half} = KE_{o} - \frac{1}{4}KE_{o} = \frac{3}{4}KE_{o} \\
    &= \frac{3}{4} \cdot 400kJ = 300 kJ \\
    E_{added} &= \%_{eff} \cdot \Delta KE = 0.40 \cdot 300kJ \\
    &= \boxed{120kJ}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Question 2:} If a 15 kWh battery has to be recharged using a 60\% efficient generator with peak power of 500 W, how long does the generator need to run to fully charge the battery?

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Generator Output} = 500 \cdot 0.6 = 300 W  \\
    15 kWh = 15 kWh \cdot 1000   \frac{W}{kW}  = 15000 Wh\\
    \frac{15000 Wh}{300 W} = \boxed{50 hours} \\
\end{align*}








\textbf{Question 3:} What is the energy stored in a 4 nF capacitor charged to 9V?
\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
    E = \frac{1}{2}CV^{2}\\
    E = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 4\cdot 10^{-9}\cdot(9)^{2}\\
    E =  \boxed{1.62 \cdot 10^{-7} J}\\
\end{align*}


\textbf{Question 4:} What voltage is needed to charge the capacitor from the above question enough to lift a 2-gram mass 15 cm?

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
    PE = mgh\\
    PE = 2g\cdot \frac{kg}{1000 g} \cdot9.81 \cdot 15cm \cdot \frac{m}{100 cm} = 0.002943 J\\ 
    \frac{1}{2}CV^{2} =  0.002943\\
    V = \boxed{1213 V}

    I3 = 1/15 A\\
    10(I2) = 1\\
    I2 = 1/10 A\\
    I1 = I2 + I3 + I\\
    1/3 = 1/10 + 1/15 + I\\
    I = 0.16667 A\\

\section*{Equivalent Resistance / Power}
\textbf{Question 9:} Find equivalent resistance for the circuits below.

\begin{center}

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/image.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Part 1:}

We calculate the equivalent resistance step by step:

1. \( R_8 \) and \( R_{10} \) are in series:  
   \( R_{s1} = R_8 + R_{10} = 12 \, \Omega \).

2. \( R_{s1} \) and \( R_9 \) are in parallel:  
   \( R_{p1} = \left( \frac{1}{R_{s1}} + \frac{1}{R_9} \right)^{-1} = 4 \, \Omega \).

3. \( R_{p1} \) and \( R_7 \) are in series:  
   \( R_{s2} = R_{p1} + R_7 = 12 \, \Omega \).

4. \( R_{s2} \) and \( R_6 \) are in parallel:  
   \( R_{p2} = \left( \frac{1}{R_{s2}} + \frac{1}{R_6} \right)^{-1} = 4 \, \Omega \).

5. \( R_{p2} \) and \( R_5 \) are in series:  
   \( R_{s3} = R_{p2} + R_5 = 8 \, \Omega \).

6. \( R_{s3} \) and \( R_4 \) are in parallel:  
   \( R_{p3} = \left( \frac{1}{R_{s3}} + \frac{1}{R_4} \right)^{-1} = 4 \, \Omega \).

7. \( R_{p3} \) and \( R_3 \) are in series:  
   \( R_{s4} = R_{p3} + R_3 = 8 \, \Omega \).

8. \( R_{s4} \) and \( R_2 \) are in parallel:  
   \( R_{p4} = \left( \frac{1}{R_{s4}} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)^{-1} = 4 \, \Omega \).

9. \( R_{p4} \) and \( R_1 \) are in series:  
   \( R_{s5} = R_{p4} + R_1 = 10 \, \Omega \).

Thus, the total equivalent resistance is \( R_{\text{eq}} = 10 \, \Omega \).

\bigskip

\textbf{Part 2:}

For the second circuit:

1. The 4$\Omega$ and 8$\Omega$ resistors are in series:  
   \( R_1 = 4 \, \Omega + 8 \, \Omega = 12 \, \Omega \).

2. Two 6$\Omega$ resistors are in parallel:  
   \( R_2 = \left( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \right)^{-1} = 3 \, \Omega \).

3. The 3$\Omega$ from Step 2 and another 3$\Omega$ resistor are in series:  
   \( R_3 = 3 \, \Omega + 3 \, \Omega = 6 \, \Omega \).

4. The 6$\Omega$ from Step 3 and the 12$\Omega$ from Step 1 are in parallel:  
   \( R_4 = \left( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12} \right)^{-1} = 4 \, \Omega \).

5. The 4$\Omega$ from Step 4 and the 2$\Omega$ resistor are in series:  
   \( R_{\text{eq}} = 4 \, \Omega + 2 \, \Omega = 6 \, \Omega \).

Thus, the total equivalent resistance is \( R_{\text{eq}} = 6 \, \Omega \).
\bigskip


\textbf{Question 10:} If the voltage between nodes A and B in the second circuit is 9V...
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the current through the 3 ohm resistor?
\begin{align*}
    \text{We can simplify to 2 Ohm and 4 Ohm in series}\\
    V4 = 9 \cdot (4/6) = 6 V\\
    \text{The 4 ohm is a 6 ohm and 12 Ohm in parallel}\\
    I6 = (6/4)\cdot(12/18) = 1A\\
    \boxed{I3 = 1 A}\\
\end{align*}
\item What is the power through the 3 ohm resistor?
\begin{align*}
    P = I^{2}R\\
    P = (1)(3) = 3W\\
    \boxed{P = 3W}\\
\end{align*}
\item What is the power through the 8 ohm resistor?
\begin{align*}
   I8 = (6/4)\cdot (6/18) = 0.5 A\\
    P = I^{2}R = (0.5)^{2} \cdot 8\\
   \boxed{P = 2W}\\
\end{align*}
\item What resistor has the highest power output?
\begin{align*}
   \text{The 3 ohm resistor has a higher power output than the 8 ohm resistor}
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{PWM}
\textbf{Question 11:} Imagine a square wave that outputs 15W from 0 to 12 seconds and 5W from 12 to 20 seconds. This square wave corresponds to a 10 ohm resistor.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the Average Power of this waveform?
\begin{align*}
   P = ((15)(12) + (5)(8))/20 = 11 W\\
   \boxed{P = 11 W}\\
\end{align*}
    \item What is the RMS Voltage of this waveform?
\begin{align*}
   Vrms  = ((Pavg)(R))^{1/2}= 10.49 V\\
   \boxed{Vrms = 10.49 V}\\
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Question 12:} Given a limited portion of this graphed waveform, what is its duty cycle?

    \text{Let's label current through 5Ohm as I1 and current through 20Ohm as I2}\\
    I1 + 3 = I2 \\
    25 - 5I1 - 20(I1 + 3) = 0\\
    I1 = -1.4\\
    I2 = -1.6\\
    Voc = (I2)(20) = \boxed{32V}\\
    Rt = 8 Ohms\\
    Isc = 32/8 = \boxed{4A}\\
\end{align*}
\textbf{Question 14:} If this circuit were to be placed in series with another circuit with an IV equation of \(I = 0.005V - 0.025\), assuming the same polarities given above, what would be the operating current and voltage?

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Let's write an equation to represent the previous circuit}\\
    I = -0.125V +4\\
     \text{Combine the two equations}\\
    -0.125V +4 = 0.005V - 0.025\\
    0.13V  = 4.025\\
    V = \boxed{30.96 V}\\
    I = \boxed{0.13 A}\\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Question 15:} If the open circuit voltage of a circuit containing ideal sources and resistors is measured at Voc = 8 V, while the current through the short circuit across the circuit is Isc = 200 mA, what would be the power in watts absorbed by an ideal voltage source, Vs = 4, placed across the terminals?

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/14.png}

\end{center}

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Let's find R thevenin}\\
   R = Voc/Isc = (8)/(200/1000) = 40 ohms\\
   I = Vnet/R = (8 -4)/40 = 0.1 A\\
   P = VI = (0.1)(4) = \boxed{0.4 W}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
    \text{This is a nodal analysis problem}\\
  ( 10 - A)/10 + 2 = A/20\\
  A = \boxed{20 V}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
    \text{The drop across the 10 ohm is a gain of 10V}\\
    \text{Let's call the node between the 30ohm, 50ohm, 2A node D}\\
    D/30 + 2 = (10 - D)/50\\
    D =  -33.75\\

    \text{The drop across the 30 ohm is a gain of 33.75V}\\
\end{align*}

\section*{Diodes}
\textbf{Question 21:} Assume an ideal-offset model and Von = 1 volt. If Vs = 5 cos(\(\omega\)t) volts and V1 = 2 volts, what are the maximum and minimum voltages across the open nodes?

\begin{center}

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/21_sol.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Solution:} 
Both branches of the diode cannot be ON at the same time, as if positive current flows through one, negative current would flow through the other (which is impossible). We start by solving for $V_{out}$ assuming one diode configuration is ON (below, we start with the left branch) while the other is OFF.

KVL Loops are shown above with assumptions the Voltage source has extremes high or low enough that they will conduct current.
\begin{align*}
    V_{out} = 2V-1V = 1V.
\end{align*}
\indent For current to flow in the correct direction, the voltage on the right of the resistor must have a larger value than the voltage on the left. We have determined $V_{out} = 1V$, we now check whether $V_S$ can be smaller than that number.
\begin{align*}
    V_{S\min} = -5V < 1V \Rightarrow \boxed{V_{out\min} = 1V}
\end{align*}
\indent Restart this process with the KVL loop with the right branch of diodes. 
\begin{align*}
    V_{out} = 1V+1V = 2V
\end{align*}
\indent Current must flow in the resistor from left to right to satisfy the diode assumption. Find a value of $V_S$ that is greater than our calculated $V_{out}$
\begin{align*}
    V_{S\max} = 5 > 2V \Rightarrow \boxed{V_{out\max} = 2V}
\end{align*}


\textbf{Question 22:} In the circuit below, which diodes are on? Furthermore, if Vs = 10 V, all the diodes have Von = 2V under the offset ideal model, and the voltage drop over R1 is also 2V, what is the voltage drop across the other resistors, assuming they have an equal resistance?

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/q22_sol.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Solution:} 

When looking at $D_3$, we notice two things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{positive} terminal of $D_3$ is connected to the \textbf{negative} terminal of $V_S$ through a resistor.
    \item There is only one source of power in the circuit ($V_S$). (Because of this, the smallest nodal voltage that any node could be held at is 0V (the negative terminal of the $V_S$))
\end{itemize}

Thus, it is impossible for the voltage difference across the diode, $V_{D_3}$, to be greater than $0V$. In fact, if we assume $D_1$ to be on, we can calculate that $V_{yellow} = V_S - V_{R_1} - V_{ON} = 6V$. $V_{pink}$ would need to be $2V$ greater than $V_{yellow}$ in order for $D_3$ to turn on. Since a resistor is a passive component (adds no power to the circuit), it is impossible to raise the pink node to above $6V+2V = 8V$, which would allow $D_3$ to turn on 

Since $D_3$ is not conducting any current, $I_{R_1} = I_{R_2} = I_{R_3} = I_{D_1} = I_{D_2} > 0A $. 
We know the currents will be positive since $R_1$'s voltage drop is positive and moving away from the voltage source 
(no other supply of power in the circuit). 
Because the currents are all positive, we can conlcude that \boxed{D_1 \text{ and } D2 \text{ are ON}}. 
For any two resistors of equal resistance and equal current, 
we know that their voltage drops must also be equal.
 Algebraically, we can show this as follows:
\begin{align*}
    I_{R_1} &= I_{R_2} = I_{R_3} \\
    \text{Using Ohm's Law: }\frac{2V}{R} &= \frac{V_{R_2}}{R} = \frac{V_{R_3}}{R} \\
    2V &= V_{R_2} = V_{R_3} \\ 
    V_{R_2} &= \boxed {2V } \\
    V_{R_3} &= \boxed {2V }
\end{align*}

\section*{BJTs}
\textbf{Question 23:} The properties of the transistor are that VBE on is 1V, \(\beta\) is 120, and VCE sat is 0.2 V. In this circuit, VCC is 9V, RC is 150\(\Omega\), and RB is 30000\(\Omega\). What are the maximum and minimum values for VCE if Vi’s output is variable between 0V and 9V?

\begin{center}

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/56.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Solution:} 

An important property of BJTs is that $V_{CE}$ can only ever assume the values ranging from $[V_{CE,sat},V_{CC}]$. A great graph to view that displays the behavior of a BJT is Figure 6 of the Canvas Module, "BJT Applications."

Calculate $V_{CE}$ assuming that the BJT is in the ON, ACTIVE region for both extreme values of $V_i$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $I_C \le 0$ (equivalent statements: $V_{CE} > V_{CC}$, $V_i < V_{BE,ON}$), then the assumption that the BJT is ON is incorrect, and $V_{CE}$'s actual value is $V_{CC}$.
    \item If $V_{CE,sat} < V_{CE} < V_{CC}$, then the assumption that the BJT is in the ON, ACTIVE region is correct and the calculated value of $V_{CE}$ is correct.
    \item If $V_{CE} \le V_{CE,sat}$, then the BJT is in the ON, SATURATED region and $V_{CE}$'s actual value is $V_{CE,sat}$.
\end{itemize}

We see that $V_I$ gets below the value of $V_{BE,ON}$, so we know that
\begin{center}
    \boxed{V_{CE,max} = V_{CC} = 9V}.
\end{center}

Assuming the BJT is in the active region: 
\begin{align*}
    I_C &= \beta I_B \\
    \frac{V_{CC}-V_{CE,min}}{R_C} &= \beta \frac{V_{i,max} - V_{BE,on}}{R_B} \\
    \Rightarrow V_{CE,min} &= V_{CC} - \beta\frac{R_C(V_{i,max} - V_{BE,on})}{R_B} \\
    V_{CE,min} &= 9V - (120)\frac{(150\Omega)(9V-1V)}{30k\Omega} \\
    V_{CE,min}&= \boxed{4.2V} \text{ (within bounds } V_{CE,sat}<V_{CE}< V_{CC}. \text{)}
\end{align*} 

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Question 24:} If Vi was set to 5V, what would VCE be?

\textbf{Solution:}

Assume that the BJT is in the active region: 
\begin{align*}
    I_C &= \beta I_B \\
    \frac{V_{CC}-V_{CE}}{R_C} &= \beta \frac{V_i - V_{BE,on}}{R_B} \\
    \Rightarrow V_{CE} &= V_{CC} - \beta\frac{R_C(V_i - V_{BE,on})}{R_B} \\
    V_{CE} &= 9V - (120)\frac{(150\Omega)(5V-1V)}{30k\Omega} \\
    &= \boxed{6.6V} \text{ (within bounds } V_{CE,sat}<V_{CE}< V_{CC}. \text{)}
\end{align*}

Since $V_{CE}$ is in the range $V_{CE,sat} < V_{CE} < V_{CC}$, we know our assumption that the BJT was in the active region is correct, and our calculated $V_{CE}$ is correct.

   Vr = 30 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 120 = 3.6\\
   Vds = 6 - 3.6 = \boxed{2.4}\\
